	 ('Romeo and Juliet','Romeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity. The plot is based on an Italian tale written by Matteo Bandello and translated into verse as The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562 and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567. Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both but expanded the plot by developing a number of supporting characters, particularly Mercutio and Paris. Believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595, the play was first published in a quarto version in 1597. The text of the first quarto version was of poor quality, however, and later editions corrected the text to conform more closely with Shakespeare''s original.','tragedy','2024-04-12 18:43:04.135821+03','2024-04-18 16:26:29.654356+03','1597-01-01 02:30:17+02:30:17',true,'romeo-and-juliet',2,2,9,2),

	 ('Cop Hater','Written by Evan Hunter using the name Ed McBain, the book was inspired by a television show he greatly admired, Dragnet. McBain chose to set his 87th Precinct series in the fictional city of Isola, based on New York City. In 1958 it was made into a film of the same name. In 1961, NBC developed an hour-long TV series 87th Precinct. McBain''''s work inspired many other writers and television producers to further develop the police procedural genre. Most notably, in 1981 Steven Bochco produced the award-winning Hill Street Blues for NBC. Bochco set his gritty police drama in a precinct house in a fictional city much as McBain did in Cop Hater. Apparently, Evan Hunter was unhappy with the similarity but he was reminded of his own borrowing of his predecessor''s ideas.','sci-fict','2024-04-12 18:39:28.93529+03','2024-04-18 16:24:36.325317+03','1956-01-01 03:00:00+03',true,'cop-hater',4,2,9,2),
